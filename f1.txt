 image With powerful zzzzz editing tools such as Photoshop and GIMP being 
easily accessible, image manipulation has become very easy. Hence, developing 
forensic tools to determine the origin or verify the authenticity of a digital image is 
important. These tools provide an indication as to whether an image is modified 
and the region where the modification has occurred. A number of methods have 
been developed for digital image forensics. For example, forensic tools have been 
developed to detect copy-move attacks, and splicing attacks. Methods are also able 
to identify the manipulated region regardless of the manipulation types. Other tools 
are able to identify the digital image capture device used to acquire the image, 
which can be a first step in many types of image forensics analysis. The capture of 
“real” digital images (not computer-generated images) can be roughly divided into 
two categories: digital cameras and scanners. 
This paper mainly concentrated on forensics analysis of images captured 
by scanners. Unlike camera images, scanned images usually contain additional 
features produced in the pre-scanning stage, such as noise patterns or artifacts 
generated by the devices producing the “hard-copy” image or document. These 
scanner-independent features increase the difficulty in scanner model identification. 
Many scanners also use 1D “line” sensors, which are different than the 2D “area”
